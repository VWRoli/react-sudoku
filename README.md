# Sudoku Solver App

## Intro

Sudoku solver application, which is optimized for both mobile and desktop devices. If you are stuck with a puzzle just put in your numbers, the application can solve it in seconds. Or if the puzzle is not solvable you get an error message.

## Description

The app was created with React and Typescript. I used a backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzles. I based my solving algorithm on the following two articles:
